INTRODUCTION
==============================================
Welcome to the game of chance! the most twisty number game out there!!!!
the aim of the game is to get the nearest count to 53, where the closest wins. each match lasts
10 goes and the best out of that 10 wins!!
if there is a draw, a final match is played.

==============================================
HOW TO INTERACT
==============================================
This is how it works, first you get given a number next to your name, the computer also gets
given a number, depending on weather you can beat the computer with the number you have you
can either press

hit me = give me another number
call = ask to see the computers count (to find out whos won)

to make things interesting. you cannot see the computers number count till you call it, so its a
gamble either way

so good luck
and happy playing :P
