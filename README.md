### More Info
 
i have added one of my own button ocx controls, however i appritiate that some people dont have this control so ive placed it in the zip named 'XP_Command1.oc_'. all you need to do is rename it, then copy it to your system folder. if you dont trust it, check my other articles out (where i have posted the source for the ocx :P) hope this dosent put neone off. thx, steve
